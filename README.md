PROJECT DIABETES CLASSIFICATION
This project aims to explore various machine learning techniques to classify individuals based on specific parameters, determining the likelihood of having diabetes, pre-diabetes, or maintaining a healthy status. By utilizing diverse methodologies, we aim to elucidate predictive patterns and contribute to the development of robust classification models in the field of diabetes diagnosis and management.
